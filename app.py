With several days of rain forecasted, the soil will likely retain higher moisture levels, which can be beneficial for water-dependent crops but may pose challenges for drainage-sensitive ones. The consistent rainfall until April 20 suggests that the soil will be highly saturated, increasing the risk of soil erosion and nutrient leaching, especially on slopes and in poorly drained areas. However, the break in precipitation by April 21 and 22 could allow the top layers of soil to dry out slightly, reducing the risk of anaerobic conditions which harm root growth. This period of no rain, combined with relatively stable temperatures, may offer an ideal window for planting or applying soil amendments, as the conditions allow for easier working of the soil and better root establishment." + "\n\n"

The weather has also played a critical role; recent unpredictable patterns have led to concerns about yield variability.
